                                HOMEWORK 1
		   	due Wednesday, Sept. 19
		NOTE:  I am asking for both hardcopy and
			to submit the assignment online.  (See below.)

For homework 1, you must write a simple program in assembly.
The program is the C program:  hw1-factorial.c
in the course directory.
You can test the C program via:  gcc hw1-factorial.c ; ./a.out

Your program must print a prompt, read an integer, and then write the
answer, as is done in hw1-factorial.c .
Page B-44 of the text shows how to use system calls.  The system calls
that you need are:  print_str, read_int, print_int, and exit

Note also that hw1-example* gives you a simple C program, along with
two translations to Assembly.  (The first translation is short, but
also takes some shortcuts.  The second version is closer to what
you need for your homework.)
[ hw1-example* should appear soon. ]

In addition, you must include each line of the C source code as
a comment just before the corresponding assembly code.
For example:
 # x = y + z;
 add $t4, $t2, $t1
 # x -= 2;
 sub $t4, $t4, 2

You must both submit on-line and hand in hardcopy of your assembly source.
To submit on-line, login to the UNIX system and do:
    /course/cs2600gc/submit-cs2600gc-hw1  hw1.tar.gz
(assuming that this contains your assembly program, hw1.s)

The online version is due by the end of the due date (by midnight,
or a few hours after midnight).  The hardcopy version can be printed
later, and brought to the next class after the due date.

======================================================================
See the course home page for the Mars MIPS simulator.

Note that page B-44 of Appendix B has a table of "system services"
(system calls).  These allow you to do I/O.

Further, the Mars simulator requires you to terminate your program
by calling the "exit" system call.  It produces an error if your
main() routine simply returns.  The text describes the Mars simulator
under the older SPIM name (Appendix B.9).
